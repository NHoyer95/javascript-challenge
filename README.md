# javascript-challenge

This repo contains a demonstration of javascripting to build a filterable table that is presented via an HTML Server.

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was written that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Using a date form in a HTML document, JavaScript code was written that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
